React Dropzone Uploader is a customizable file dropzone and uploader for React.


## Installation
`npm install --save react-dropzone-uploader`

Import default styles in your app.

~~~js
import 'react-dropzone-uploader/dist/styles.css'
~~~


## `Dropzone`
RDU handles common use cases with almost no config. The following code gives you a dropzone and clickable file input that accepts image, audio and video files. It uploads files to `https://httpbin.org/post`, and renders a button to submit files that are done uploading.

>You can edit code for this example __and see changes live__. Open your browser's console to see how RDU manages file metadata and the upload lifecycle.
